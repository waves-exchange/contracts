After receiving the 'Community Verified' status, the token no longer needs to participate in the voting to maintain that status. \nAdd the ability for users to offer a bonus (reward) to those who voted for the verification of their proposed token. \nAdd the ability for the users who have at least 1000 gWX on their balance to complain about a verified token. Such a complaint initiates voting (that cannot be prolonged) to remove the token's verified status."
